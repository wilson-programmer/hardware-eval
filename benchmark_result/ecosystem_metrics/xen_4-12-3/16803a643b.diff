Subject: [PATCH] xen/x86: domctl: Don't leak data via XEN_DOMCTL_gethvmcontext

The HVM context may not fill up the full buffer passed by the caller.
While we report corectly the size of the context, we will still be
copying back the full size of the buffer.

As the buffer is allocated through xmalloc(), we will be copying some
bits from the previous allocation.

Only copy back the part of the buffer used by the HVM context to prevent
any leak.

Note that per XSA-72, this is not a security issue.
