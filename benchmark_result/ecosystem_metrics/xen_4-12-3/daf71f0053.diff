+CONTROL			<command>|[<parameters>|]
+	Send a control command <command> with optional parameters
+	(<parameters>) to Xenstore daemon.
+
+	The set of commands and their semantics is implementation
+	specific and is likely to change from one Xen version to the
+	next.  Out-of-tree users will encounter compatibility issues.
+
+	Current commands are:
+	check
+		checks xenstored innards
+	log|on
+		turn xenstore logging on
+	log|off
+		turn xenstore logging off
+	logfile|<file-name>
+		log to specified file
+	memreport|[<file-name>]
+		print memory statistics to logfile (no <file-name>
+		specified) or to specific file
+	print|<string>
+		print <string> to syslog (xenstore runs as daemon) or
+		to console (xenstore runs as stubdom)
+	help			<supported-commands>
+		return list of supported commands for CONTROL
+
+DEBUG
+	Deprecated, now named CONTROL
