Subject: [PATCH] x86/vmx: Avoid hitting BUG_ON() after EPTP-related
 domain_crash()

If the EPTP pointer can't be located in the altp2m list, the domain
is (legitimately) crashed.

Under those circumstances, execution will continue and guarentee to hit the
BUG_ON(idx >= MAX_ALTP2M) (unfortunately, just out of context).

Return from vmx_vmexit_handler() after the domain_crash(), which also has the
side effect of reentering the scheduler more promptly.
