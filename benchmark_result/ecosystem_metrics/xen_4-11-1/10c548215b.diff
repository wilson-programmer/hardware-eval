Subject: [PATCH] xen: oprofile/nmi_int.c: Drop unwanted sexual reference

This is not really very nice.

This line doesn't have much value in itself.  The rest of this comment
block is pretty clear what it wants to convey.  So delete it.

(While we are here, adopt the CODING_STYLE-mandated formatting.)
