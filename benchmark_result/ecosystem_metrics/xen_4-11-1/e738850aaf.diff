Subject: [PATCH] x86/mm: Don't perform flush after failing to update a guests
 L1e

If the L1e update hasn't occured, the flush cannot do anything useful.  This
skips the potentially expensive vcpumask_to_pcpumask() conversion, and
broadcast TLB shootdown.

More importantly however, we might be in the error path due to a bad va
parameter from the guest, and this should not propagate into the TLB flushing
logic.  The INVPCID instruction for example raises #GP for a non-canonical
address.

This is XSA-279.
