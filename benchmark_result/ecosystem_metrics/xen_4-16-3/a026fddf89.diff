Subject: [PATCH] SUPPORT.md: clarify support of untrusted driver domains with
 oxenstored

Add a support statement for the scope of support regarding different
Xenstore variants. Especially oxenstored does not (yet) have security
support of untrusted driver domains, as those might drive oxenstored
out of memory by creating lots of watch events for the guests they are
servicing.

Add a statement regarding Live Update support of oxenstored.

This is part of XSA-326.
