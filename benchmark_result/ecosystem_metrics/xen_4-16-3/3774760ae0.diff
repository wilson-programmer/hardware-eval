Subject: [PATCH] tools/ocaml/xenstored/store.ml: fix build error
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Building with Dune in release mode fails with:
```
File "ocaml/xenstored/store.ml", line 464, characters 13-32:
Warning 18: this type-based record disambiguation is not principal.
File "ocaml/xenstored/store.ml", line 1:
Error: Some fatal warnings were triggered (1 occurrences)
```

This is a warning to help keep the code futureproof, quoting from its
documentation:
> Check information path during type-checking, to make sure that all types are
> derived in a principal way. When using labelled arguments and/or polymorphic
> methods, this flag is required to ensure future versions of the compiler will
> be able to infer types correctly, even if internal algorithms change. All
> programs accepted in -principal mode are also accepted in the default mode with
> equivalent types, but different binary signatures, and this may slow down type
> checking; yet it is a good idea to use it once before publishing source code.
