Subject: [PATCH] x86/pv-shim: correctly ignore empty onlining requests
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Mem-op requests may have zero extents. Such requests need treating as
no-ops. pv_shim_online_memory(), however, would have tried to take 2Â³Â²-1
order-sized pages from its balloon list (to then populate them),
typically ending when the entire set of ballooned pages of this order
was consumed.

Note that pv_shim_offline_memory() does not have such an issue.
