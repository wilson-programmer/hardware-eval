Subject: [PATCH] x86: fix build race when generating temporary object files
 (take 2)

The original commit wasn't quite sufficient: Emptying DEPS is helpful
only when nothing will get added to it subsequently. xen/Rules.mk will,
after including the local Makefile, amend DEPS by dependencies for
objects living in sub-directories though. For the purpose of suppressing
dependencies of the makefiles on the .*.d2 files (and thus to avoid
their re-generation) it is, however, not necessary at all to play with
DEPS. Instead we can override DEPS_INCLUDE (which generally is a late-
expansion variable).
