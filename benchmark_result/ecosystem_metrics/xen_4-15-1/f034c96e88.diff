Subject: [PATCH] x86/spec-ctrl: Mitigate TAA after S3 resume

The user chosen setting for MSR_TSX_CTRL needs restoring after S3.

All APs get the correct setting via start_secondary(), but the BSP was missed
out.

This is XSA-377 / CVE-2021-28690.

Fixes: 8c4330818f6 ("x86/spec-ctrl: Mitigate the TSX Asynchronous Abort sidechannel")

Reviewed-by: Jan Beulich <jbeulich@suse.com>
(cherry picked from commit 8cf276cb2e0b99b96333865873f56b0b31555ff1)
