Subject: [PATCH] xen: io: Fix race between sending an I/O and domain shutdown

Xen provides hypercalls to shutdown (SCHEDOP_shutdown{,_code}) and
resume a domain (XEN_DOMCTL_resumedomain). They can be used for checkpoint
where the expectation is the domain should continue as nothing happened
afterwards.

hvmemul_do_io() and handle_pio() will act differently if the return
code of hvm_send_ioreq() (resp. hvmemul_do_pio_buffer()) is X86EMUL_RETRY.

In this case, the I/O state will be reset to STATE_IOREQ_NONE (i.e
no I/O is pending) and/or the PC will not be advanced.

If the shutdown request happens right after the I/O was sent to the
IOREQ, then emulation code will end up to re-execute the instruction
and therefore forward again the same I/O (at least when reading IO port).

This would be problem if the access has a side-effect. A dumb example,
is a device implementing a counter which is incremented by one for every
access. When running shutdown/resume in a loop, the value read by the
OS may not be the old value + 1.

Add an extra boolean in the structure hvm_vcpu_io to indicate whether
the I/O was suspended. This is then used in place of checking the domain
is shutting down in hvmemul_do_io() and handle_pio() as they should
act on suspend (i.e. vcpu_start_shutdown_deferral() returns false) rather
than shutdown.
