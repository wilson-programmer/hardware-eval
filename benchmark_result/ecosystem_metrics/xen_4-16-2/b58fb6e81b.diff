Subject: [PATCH] x86/irq: skip unmap_domain_pirq XSM during destruction
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

xsm_unmap_domain_irq was seen denying unmap_domain_pirq when called from
complete_domain_destroy as an RCU callback.  The source context was an
unexpected, random domain.  Since this is a xen-internal operation,
going through the XSM hook is inapproriate.

Check d->is_dying and skip the XSM hook when set since this is a cleanup
operation for a domain being destroyed.
