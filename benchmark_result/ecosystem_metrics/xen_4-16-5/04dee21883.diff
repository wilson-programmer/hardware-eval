Subject: [PATCH] x86/cpu-policy: Advertise MSR_ARCH_CAPS to guests by default

With xl/libxl now able to control the policy bits for MSR_ARCH_CAPS, it is
safe to advertise to guests by default.  In turn, we don't need the special
case to expose details to dom0.

This advertises MSR_ARCH_CAPS to guests on *all* Intel hardware, even if the
register content ends up being empty.

  - Advertising ARCH_CAPS and not RSBA signals "retpoline is safe here and
    everywhere you might migrate to".  This is important because it avoids the
    guest kernel needing to rely on model checks.

  - Alternatively, levelling for safety across the Broadwell/Skylake divide
    requires advertising ARCH_CAPS and RSBA, meaning "retpoline not safe on
    some hardware you might migrate to".

On Cascade Lake and later hardware, guests can now see RDCL_NO (not vulnerable
to Meltdown) amongst others.  This causes substantial performance
improvements, as guests are no longer applying software mitigations in cases
where they don't need to.
