Subject: [PATCH] vpci/header: cope with devices not having vpci allocated
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When traversing the list of pci devices assigned to a domain cope with
some of them not having the vpci struct allocated. It should be
possible for the hardware domain to have read-only devices assigned
that are not handled by vPCI, such support will be added by further
patches.
