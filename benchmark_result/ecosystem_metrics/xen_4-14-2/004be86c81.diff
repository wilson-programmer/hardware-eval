Subject: [PATCH] tools/oxenstored: Fix quota calculation for mkdir EEXIST
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

We increment the domain's quota on mkdir even when the node already exists.
This results in a quota inconsistency after live update, where reconstructing
the tree from scratch results in a different quota.

Not a security issue because the domain uses up quota faster, so it will only
get a Quota error sooner than it should.

Found by the structured fuzzer.
