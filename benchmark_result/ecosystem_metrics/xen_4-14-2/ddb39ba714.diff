Subject: [PATCH] SUPPORT.MD: Clarify the support state for the Arm SMMUv{1, 2}
 drivers

SMMUv{1, 2} are both marked as security supported, so we would
technically have to issue an XSA for any IOMMU security bug.

However, at the moment, device passthrough is not security supported
on Arm and there is no plan to change that in the next few months.

Therefore, mark Arm SMMUv{1, 2} as supported but not security supported.
