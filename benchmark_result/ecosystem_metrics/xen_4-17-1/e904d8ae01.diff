Subject: [PATCH] x86/vmx: Support for CPUs without model-specific LBR

Ice Lake (server at least) has both architectural LBR and model-specific LBR.
Sapphire Rapids does not have model-specific LBR at all.  I.e. On SPR and
later, model_specific_lbr will always be NULL, so we must make changes to
avoid reliably hitting the domain_crash().

The Arch LBR spec states that CPUs without model-specific LBR implement
MSR_DBG_CTL.LBR by discarding writes and always returning 0.

Do this for any CPU for which we lack model-specific LBR information.

Adjust the now-stale comment, now that the Arch LBR spec has created a way to
signal "no model specific LBR" to guests.
