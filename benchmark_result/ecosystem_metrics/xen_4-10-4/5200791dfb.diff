Subject: [PATCH] x86/mm: fix #GP(0) in switch_cr3_cr4()

With "pcid=no-xpti" and opposite XPTI settings in two 64-bit PV domains
(achievable with one of "xpti=no-dom0" or "xpti=no-domu"), switching
from a PCID-disabled to a PCID-enabled 64-bit PV domain fails to set
CR4.PCIDE in time, as CR4.PGE would not be set in either (see
pv_fixup_guest_cr4(), in particular as used by write_ptbase()), and
hence the early CR4 write would be skipped.
