Subject: [PATCH] x86: Merge xc_cpu_policy's cpuid and msr objects

Right now, they're the same underlying type, containing disjoint information.

Use a single object instead.  Also take the opportunity to rename 'entries' to
'msrs' which is more descriptive, and more in line with nr_msrs being the
count of MSR entries in the API.

test-tsx uses xg_private.h to access the internals of xc_cpu_policy, so needs
updating at the same time.  Take the opportunity to improve the code clarity
by passing a cpu_policy rather than an xc_cpu_policy into some functions.

No practical change.  This undoes the transient doubling of storage space from
earlier patches.
