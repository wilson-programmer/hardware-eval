Subject: [PATCH] tboot: Disable CET at shutdown

tboot_shutdown() calls into tboot to perform the actual system shutdown.
tboot isn't built with endbr annotations, and Xen has CET-IBT enabled on
newer hardware.  shutdown_entry isn't annotated with endbr and Xen
faults:

Panic on CPU 0:
CONTROL-FLOW PROTECTION FAULT: #CP[0003] endbranch

And Xen hangs at this point.

Disabling CET-IBT let Xen and tboot power off, but reboot was
perfoming a poweroff instead of a warm reboot.  Disabling all of CET,
i.e. shadow stacks as well, lets tboot reboot properly.

Fixes: cdbe2b0a1aec ("x86: Enable CET Indirect Branch Tracking")
