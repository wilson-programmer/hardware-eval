Subject: [PATCH] iommu: fix quarantine mode command line documentation
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

With the addition of per-device quarantine page tables the sink page is now
exclusive for each device, and thus writable.  Update the documentation to
reflect the current implementation.

Fixes: 14dd241aad8a ('IOMMU/x86: use per-device page tables for quarantining')

     Therefore, if this option is set to true (the default), Xen always
