Subject: [PATCH] build: define ARCH and SRCARCH later

Defining ARCH and SRCARCH later in xen/Makefile allows to switch to
immediate evaluation variable type.

ARCH and SRCARCH depend on value defined in Config.mk and aren't used
for e.g. TARGET_SUBARCH or TARGET_ARCH, and not before they're needed in
a sub-make or a rule.

This will help reduce the number of times the shell rune is been
run.

With GNU make 4.4, the number of execution of the command present in
these $(shell ) increased greatly. This is probably because as of make
4.4, exported variable are also added to the environment of $(shell )
construct.

Also, `make -d` shows a lot of these:
    Makefile:39: not recursively expanding SRCARCH to export to shell function
    Makefile:38: not recursively expanding ARCH to export to shell function
