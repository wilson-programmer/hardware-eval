Subject: [PATCH] x86/mwait-idle: customize IceLake server support

On ICX platform, the C1E auto-promotion is enabled by default.
As a result, the CPU might fall into C1E more offen than previous
platforms. So disable C1E auto-promotion and expose C1E as a separate
idle state.

Beside C1 and C1E, the exit latency of C6 was measured
by a dedicated tool. However the exit latency(41us) exposed
by _CST is much smaller than the one we measured(128us). This
is probably due to the _CST uses the exit latency when woken
up from PC0+C6, rather than PC6+C6 when C6 was measured. Choose
the latter as we need the longest latency in theory.
