Subject: [PATCH] xen/arm: Missing N1/A76/A75 FP registers in vCPU context
 switch

Xen has cpu_has_fp/cpu_has_simd to detect whether the CPU supports
FP/SIMD or not. But currently, these two MACROs only consider value 0
of ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.FP/SIMD as FP/SIMD features enabled. But for CPUs
that support FP/SIMD and half-precision floating-point arithmetic, the
ID_AA64PFR0_EL1.FP/SIMD are 1 (see Arm ARM DDI0487F.b, D13.2.64).
For these CPUs, xen will treat them as no FP/SIMD support, the
vfp_save/restore_state will not take effect.

From the TRM documents of Cortex-A75/A76/N1, we know these CPUs support
basic Advanced SIMD/FP and half-precision floating-point arithmetic. In
this case, on N1/A76/A75 platforms, Xen will always miss the floating
pointer registers save/restore. If different vCPUs are running on the
same pCPU, the floating pointer registers will be corrupted randomly.

This patch fixes Xen on these new cores.
