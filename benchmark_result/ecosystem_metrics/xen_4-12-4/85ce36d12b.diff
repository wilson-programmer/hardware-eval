Subject: [PATCH] x86/S3: put data segment registers into known state upon
 resume
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

wakeup_32 sets %ds and %es to BOOT_DS, while leaving %fs at what
wakeup_start did set it to, and %gs at whatever BIOS did load into it.
All of this may end up confusing the first load_segments() to run on
the BSP after resume, in particular allowing a non-nul selector value
to be left in %fs.

Alongside %ss, also put all other data segment registers into the same
state that the boot and CPU bringup paths put them in.
