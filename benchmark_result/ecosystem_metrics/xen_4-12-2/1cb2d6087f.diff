Subject: [PATCH] docs/misc: xen-command-line: Remove wrong statement from
 serrors=diverse

When serrors=diverse is selected by the user, we will only synchronize
the pending SErrors on entry to hypervisor from guest context and exit
from guest to hypervisor context.

We don't need synchronize SErrors between guest context switch as they
would be categorized to Hypervisor generated SErrors in any case.

   2. dsb/isb on EL2 -> EL1 return paths to prevent slipping hypervisor
