Subject: [PATCH] x86/crash: force unlock console before printing on kexec
 crash

There is a small window where shootdown NMI might come to a CPU
(e.g. in serial interrupt handler) where console lock is taken. In order
not to leave following console prints waiting infinitely for shot down
CPUs to free the lock - force unlock the console.

The race has been frequently observed while crashing nested Xen in
an HVM domain.
