Subject: [PATCH] docs/misc: xen-command-line: Rework documentation of the
 option 'serrors'

The current documentation is misleading for a few reasons:
    1) The synchronization happens on all exit/entry from/to the guest.
       This includes from EL0 (i.e userspace).
    2) Trusted guest can also generate SErrors (e.g. memory failure)
    3) Without RAS support, SErrors are IMP DEFINED. Unless you have a
    complete TRM in hand, you can't really make a decision.
    4) The documentation is written around performance when this is not
    the first concern.

The documentation is now reworked to focus on the consequences of using
serrors="panic" and avoid to go in details on the exact implementation.

 * `diverse`:
-  The hypervisor will distinguish guest SErrors from hypervisor SErrors.
-  The guest generated SErrors will be forwarded to guests, the hypervisor
-  generated SErrors will cause the whole system to crash.
-  It requires:
-  1. dsb/isb on all EL1 -> EL2 trap entries to categorize SErrors correctly.
-  2. dsb/isb on EL2 -> EL1 return paths to prevent slipping hypervisor
-     SErrors to guests.
+  The hypervisor will distinguish guest SErrors from hypervisor SErrors:
+    - The guest generated SErrors will be forwarded to the currently running
+      guest.
+    - The hypervisor generated SErrors will cause the whole system to crash
 
 * `panic`:
-  The hypervisor will not distinguish guest SErrors from hypervisor SErrors.
-  All SErrors will crash the whole system. This option will avoid all overhead
-  of the dsb/isb pairs.
+  All SErrors will cause the whole system to crash. This option should only
+  be used if you trust all your guests and/or they don't have a gadget (e.g.
+  device) to generate SErrors in normal run.
