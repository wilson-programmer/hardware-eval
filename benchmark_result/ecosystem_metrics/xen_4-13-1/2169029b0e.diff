Subject: [PATCH] sched: fix scheduler_disable() with core scheduling

In core-scheduling mode, Xen might crash when entering ACPI S5 state.
This happens in sched_slave() during is_idle_unit(next) check because
next->vcpu_list is stale and points to an already freed memory.

This situation happens shortly after scheduler_disable() is called if
some CPU is still inside sched_slave() softirq. Current logic simply
returns prev->next_task from sched_wait_rendezvous_in() which causes
the described crash because next_task->vcpu_list has become invalid.

Fix the crash by returning NULL from sched_wait_rendezvous_in() in
the case when scheduler_disable() has been called.
