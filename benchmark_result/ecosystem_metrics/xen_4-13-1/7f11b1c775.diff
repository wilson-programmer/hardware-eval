Subject: [PATCH] VT-d: don't pass bridge devices to
 domain_context_mapping_one()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When passed a non-NULL pdev, the function does an owner check when it
finds an already existing context mapping. Bridges, however, don't get
passed through to guests, and hence their owner is always going to be
Dom0, leading to the assigment of all but one of the function of multi-
function PCI devices behind bridges to fail.
