Subject: [PATCH] tools/libxl: don't allow IOMMU usage with PoD
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Prevent libxl from creating guests that attempts to use PoD together
with an IOMMU, even if no devices are actually assigned.

While the hypervisor could support using PoD together with an IOMMU as
long as no devices are assigned, such usage seems doubtful. There's no
guarantee the guest has PoD no longer be active, and thus a later
assignment of a PCI device to such domain could fail.

Preventing the usage of PoD together with an IOMMU at guest creation
avoids having to add checks for active PoD entries in the device
assignment paths.
