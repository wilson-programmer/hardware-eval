Subject: [PATCH] x86/spec-ctrl: Mitigate Speculative Return Stack Overflow
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

On native, synthesise the SRSO bits by probing various hardware properties as
given by AMD.

Extend the IBPB-on-entry mitigations to Zen3/4 CPUs.  There is a microcode
prerequisite to make this an effective mitigation.

This is part of XSA-434 / CVE-2023-20569
