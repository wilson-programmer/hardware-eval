Subject: [PATCH] ocaml/libs/xc: Fix NULL dereference with physinfo_arch_caps()
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

`Tag_cons` is `0` and is meant to be used as the tag argument for
`caml_alloc`/`caml_alloc_small` when constructing a non-empty list.

The empty list is `Val_emptylist` instead, which is really just `Val_int(0)`.

Assigning `0` to a list value like this is equivalent to assigning the naked
pointer `NULL` to the field.  Naked pointers are not valid in OCaml 5, however
even in OCaml <5.x any attempt to iterate on the list will lead to a segfault.

The list currently only has an opaque type, so no code would have reason to
iterate on it currently, but we shouldn't construct invalid OCaml values that
might lead to a crash when exploring the type.

`Val_emptylist` is available since OCaml 3.01 as a constant.
