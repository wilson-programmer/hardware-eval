Subject: [PATCH] x86: also suppress use of MMX insns

Passing -mno-sse alone is not enough: The compiler may still find
(questionable) reasons to use MMX insns. In particular with gcc12 use
of MOVD+PUNPCKLDQ+MOVQ was observed in an apparent attempt to auto-
vectorize the storing of two adjacent zeroes, 32 bits each.
