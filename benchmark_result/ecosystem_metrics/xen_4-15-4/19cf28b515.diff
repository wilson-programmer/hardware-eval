Subject: [PATCH] Config.mk: correct PIE-related option(s) in
 EMBEDDED_EXTRA_CFLAGS

I haven't been able to find evidence of "-nopie" ever having been a
supported compiler option. The correct spelling is "-no-pie".
Furthermore like "-pie" this is an option which is solely passed to the
linker. The compiler only recognizes "-fpie" / "-fPIE" / "-fno-pie", and
it doesn't infer these options from "-pie" / "-no-pie".

Add the compiler recognized form, but for the possible case of the
variable also being used somewhere for linking keep the linker option as
well (with corrected spelling).

Build: Drop -no-pie from EMBEDDED_EXTRA_CFLAGS

This breaks all Clang builds, as demostrated by Gitlab CI.

Contrary to the description in ecd6b9759919, -no-pie is not even an option
passed to the linker.  GCC's actual behaviour is to inhibit the passing of
-pie to the linker, as well as selecting different cr0 artefacts to be linked.

EMBEDDED_EXTRA_CFLAGS is not used for $(CC)-doing-linking, and not liable to
gain such a usecase.
