Subject: [PATCH] xen/page_alloc: Keep away MFN 0 from the buddy allocator

Combining of buddies happens only such that the resulting larger buddy
is still order-aligned. To cross a zone boundary while merging, the
implication is that both the buddy [0, 2^n-1] and the buddy
[2^n, 2^(n+1)-1] are free.

Ideally we want to fix the allocator, but for now we can just prevent
adding the MFN 0 in the allocator to avoid merging across zone
boundaries.

On x86, the MFN 0 is already kept away from the buddy allocator. So the
bug can only happen on Arm platform where the first memory bank is
starting at 0.

As this is a specific to the allocator, the MFN 0 is removed in the common code
to cater all the architectures (current and future).
