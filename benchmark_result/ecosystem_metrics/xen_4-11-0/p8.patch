Subject: [PATCH] x86/HVM: attempts to emulate FPU insns need to set
 fpu_initialised

My original way of thinking here was that this would be set anyway at
the point state gets reloaded after the adjustments hvmemul_put_fpu()
does, but the flag should already be set before that - after all the
guest may never again touch the FPU before e.g. getting migrated/saved.
