Subject: [PATCH] xen/sndif: Change stream's unique-id to string

Display and input protocols define "unique-id" XenBus field as string
which is much more flexible in defining unique identifiers comparing
to integer used by sound protocol. For example, this allows to provide
UUIDs as unique ID's. Align sound protocol with display and input
and redefine "unique-id" field as string.
