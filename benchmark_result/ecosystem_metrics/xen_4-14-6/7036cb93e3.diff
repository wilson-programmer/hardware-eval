Subject: [PATCH] docs: enhance xenstore.txt with permissions description
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The permission scheme of Xenstore nodes is not really covered by
docs/misc/xenstore.txt, other than referring to the Xen wiki.

Add a paragraph explaining the permissions of nodes, and especially
mentioning removal of nodes when a domain has been removed from
Xenstore.

This is part of XSA-419.

+Each node has one or multiple permission entries.  Permissions are
+granted by domain-id, the first permission entry of each node specifies
+the owner of the node.  Permissions of a node can be changed by the
+owner of the node, the owner can only be modified by the control
+domain (usually domain id 0).  The owner always has the right to read
+and write the node, while other permissions can be setup to allow
+read and/or write access.  When a domain is being removed from Xenstore
+nodes owned by that domain will be removed together with all of those
+nodes' children.

 Communication with xenstore is via either sockets, or event channel
 and shared memory, as specified in io/xs_wire.h: each message in
 either direction is a header formatted as a struct xsd_sockmsg
