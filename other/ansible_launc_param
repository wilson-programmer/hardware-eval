To launch ansible with root privileges and provide password

ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml -u wilson -e "ansible_sudo_pass=1234" playbook3.yml

another solution with password encryption

1) Edit the playbook file by adding a file containing the password

---
# Install packages
- name: "[INSTALL PACKAGE]"
  hosts: all
  vars_files:
          - secret
  tasks:
          - name: "[Update package]"
            apt:
                    update_cache: yes
            become: yes
The file is call secret

2) run the following command to create secret file
$ ansible-vault create secret
This will ask for a password, then open your default editor to edit the file. You can put your ansible_sudo_pass in here

e.g.: secret:

ansible_sudo_pass: mysudopassword

#Save and exit, now you have an encrypted secret file which Ansible is able to decrypt when you run your playbook. Note: 
#you can edit the file with ansible-vault edit secret (and enter the password that you used when creating the file)
Create a file called vault.txt: and in that put the password that you used when creating your secret file. 
The password should be a string stored as a single line in the file.
Finally run
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts.yml -u wilson --sudo --vault-password-file=vault.txt playbook3.yml
